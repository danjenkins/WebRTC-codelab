## Stream arbitrary data with RTCDataChannel

The purpose of this session is to use the [WebRTC API RTCDataChannel](http://dev.w3.org/2011/webrtc/editor/webrtc.html#peer-to-peer-data-api) to send text between two textareas on the same page.

In the session we shall set up a connection between two peers on the same page using the the RTCPeerConnection API just like the previous session and we shall send text between them, again of limited use, but a good way for understanding how RTCDataChannel works.

- Create a new HTML5 document. (Yes another new one just to be safe).
- Add two text areas and associated buttons.
- Add JavaScript to the script element on the HTML5 page, to enable the WebRTC API RTCDataChannel.
- View your page from _localhost_.
- Bonus points of the session.
