## Bonus points

1. Try out RTCDataChannel file sharing with [Sharefest](http://www.sharefest.me/). When would RTCDataChannel need to provide reliable delivery of data, and when might performance be more important -- even if that means losing some data?
2. Use CSS to improve page layout, and add a placeholder attribute to the _dataChannelReceive_ textarea.
3. Test the page on a mobile device.

Finally if you are having any difficulty with putting this session together have a look at [complete Session 04 HTML](https://bitbucket.org/webrtc/codelab/src/master/complete/step4).
