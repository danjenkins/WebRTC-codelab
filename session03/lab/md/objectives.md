##Stream video with RTCPeerConnection

- The purpose of this session is to use the [WebRTC API RTCPeerConnection](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-jsep-04) for video and audio calling. In this session we shall set up a connection between two peers on the same page. Not much use, but good for understanding how RTCPeerConnection works!

    - Create a new HTML5 document. (Yes a new one just to be safe).
    - Add two video elements and three buttons: Start, Call and Hang Up.
    - Add JavaScript to the script element on the HTML5 page, to enable the WebRTC API RTCPeerConnection
    - View your page from _localhost_.
    - Bonus points of the session.
