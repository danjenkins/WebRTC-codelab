## Bonus points

1. Take a look at _chrome://webrtc-internals_. (There is a full list of Chrome URLs at _chrome://about_).
2. Style the page with CSS:
    - Put the videos side by side.
    - Make the buttons the same width, with bigger text.
    - Check this out on Chrome for Android.
3. From the Chrome Dev Tools console, inspect _localStream_, _localPeerConnection_ and _remotePeerConnection_.
4. Take a look at _localPeerConnection.localDescription_. What does SDP format look like?


Finally if you are having any difficulty with putting this session together have a look at [complete Session 03 HTML](https://bitbucket.org/webrtc/codelab/src/master/complete/step3).
