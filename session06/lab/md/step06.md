## Bonus points

1. This application only supports one-to-one video chat. How might you change the design to enable more than one person to share the same video chat room? (Look at [talky.io](http://talky.io) for an example of this in action.)

2. The example has the room name _foo_ hard coded. What would be the best way to enable other room names?

3. Does the app work on mobile? Try it out on a phone, on a 7" and a 10" tablet. What layout, UI and UX changes would be required to ensure a good mobile experience?

4. Deploy your app at a public URL (see above for hosting options). Try different network configurations, for example with one user on wifi and another on 3G. Any problems?

5. How would users share the room name? Try to build an alternative to sharing room names.
