## RTCPeerConnection with messaging

In this step, we build a video chat client, using the signaling server created in [Session 05](./../../session05/lab/html/objectives.html) and the RTCPeerConnection code from [Session 03](./../../session03/lab/html/objectives.html).

In order to complete this session ensure you have Nodejs, socket.io and [node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static) installed and working. If in doubt, try the code in [Session 05](./../../session05/lab/html/objectives.html).


In this example, we will build 

- build the server (the Node app) called _server.js_
- create the client web page called _index.html_.
- create the client web app called .
- view the client page from the url location _localhost:2013_.
- Carry out some bonus tasks for the session.
