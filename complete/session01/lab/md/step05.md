#Version Control

The [WebRTC code lab](https://github.com/miguelpdl/WebRTC-codelab) is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/miguelpdl/WebRTC-codelab) which means you need to have [git](http://git-scm.com) installed on your machine.

- [Installing Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

Which will point you towards the [downloader page](http://git-scm.com/downloads) for Mac and MS options.

Given that the project is on GitHub you can try the GUI clients, [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/) / [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com/)

Although I've used [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org) and found it easier to install it this way

$ sudo port install git-core +svn +doc +bash_completion +gitweb
