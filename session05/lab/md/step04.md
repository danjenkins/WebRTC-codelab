## Run the server

As per the [developer environment instalation guide](./../../../session01/lab/html/step06.html) make sure to have Node, socket.io and [node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static) installed.   

(You don't need to learn about node-static for this exercise: it just makes the server simpler.)

Now run the server (_server.js_). To start the server, run the following command from a terminal in your application directory:

~~~
$ node server.js
~~~
