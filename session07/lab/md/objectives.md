## Putting it all together: RTCPeerConnection + RTCDataChannel + signaling

This is a DIY step!

1. Take a look at the app you built in [Session 04](./../../../session04/lab/html/objectives.html).

2. Add the RTCDataChannel code to your [Session 06](./../../../session06/lab/html/objectives.html) app to create a complete application.

**In this session have a look at how the client app could use [adapter.js](https://code.google.com/p/webrtc/source/browse/stable/samples/js/base/adapter.js). This is a [JavaScript shim](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6599815/what-is-the-difference-between-a-shim-and-a-polyfill), maintained by Google, that abstracts away browser differences and spec changes.**


### Bonus points

1. The app hasn't had any work done on layout. Sort it out! Make sure your app works well on different devices.
